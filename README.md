# 3D-Interactive
interactive 3D science lessons
## Inspiration
We would love to make learning more interactive and engaging so we created a solution that can make learning more experiential.

## What it does
Our project seeks to gamify and augment learning through Augmented reality and 3D models and to reinforce learning using short lessons(micro-learning) and quizzes.

Learners can interact with 3D models by clicking on any of the card views example, the Human digestive system which will take them to a learning path that has a Ui showing certain 3D models concerning the digestive system etc , they would have to unlock one model to the other.

When any of the models is clicked(unlocked) an interface is presented to them to interact with the 3D model(digestive system etc) and they can watch videos about any of the annotated parts, watch some slides about the parts, and take quizzes.)

Learners can toggle between 3D mode and Augmented Reality mode hence, making it more immersive.

Users can also see a leaderboard of their accomplishments with others.

## How we built it
We designed the User Interface in Figma and did some deliberations over  Google Meet for hours until we settled on the desired project.

Challenges we ran into
Since we got to know about the hackathon 6 days to deadline, we had to do quick prototyping.
The decision-making process of making the immersive Ar experience work on most devices. At first, we designed it for tablets only but had to do it a web app just so any device on the internet could access it.

Currently, most of the features are static because of the 6 day period we got to know of the hackathon. But we've worked seriously on the ones that we could do within the 6 days period.


What's next for 3D Interactive
Continue building and adding new 3D models.
